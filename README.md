The game incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, utilizing Java as the programming language. This ensures a structured and modular design, making it easier to maintain and extend the game's functionality.

To determine a player's skill level, the game implements advanced search algorithms such as Min-Max and Alpha-Beta pruning. These algorithms allow the computer opponent to evaluate and select optimal moves by searching through various possible moves and their consequences. The depth level of the search can be customized, allowing players to fine-tune the difficulty and challenge level of the game.

By playing against the computer or friends, users can enhance their strategic thinking, improve their chess skills, and measure their progress over time. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn or an experienced player seeking a challenging opponent, this Java-based chess game provides an engaging and interactive platform for honing your chess abilities.
